The purpose of this competition is to utilize various techniques of data analysis and quantitative finance to trade commodities with diverse behaviors.

The competition comprises five rounds, each involving the introduction of new commodities exhibiting distinct behaviors.

* Round 1

    Participants have worked with two assets, namely **PEARLS**, whose price remains relatively constant over time at a value of 10k seashells, and **BANANAS**, an asset whose price is highly volatile, fluctuating frequently.

* Round 2

    Participants have been provided with data on **COCONUTS** and **PINA_COLADAS**. Although the price of COCONUTS and PINA_COLADAS are related, as coconuts are required for the production of pina coladas, the converse is not true.

* Round 3

    Two additional assets were introduced, **BERRIES** and **DIVING_GEAR**. The price of BERRIES is seasonal, while that of DIVING_GEAR is influenced by **DOLPHIN_SIGHTINGS**, another data set provided by IMC. The latter may serve as a feature for predicting the price of DIVING_GEAR.

* Round 4

    Participants have worked with four assets, namely **PICNIC_BASKET**, **UKULELE**, **DIP**, and **BAGUETTE**. We have been informed that one PICNIC_BASKET consists of one UKULELE, two BAGUETTEs, and four DIPs. However, the price of PICNIC_BASKET is not equivalent to the sum of the prices of its individual components.

* Round 5

    During this round, participants were granted access to IMC trader bots and were given the opportunity to replicate, or take profit from the strategy of the most experienced bots.
